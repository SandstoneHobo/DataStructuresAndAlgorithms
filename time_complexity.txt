Runtime is the time needed for an algorithm to do its job

We do not use actual runtime because there are too many factors like programming language, interpreter, hardware, and more

Time complexity is the number of operations needed to run an algorithm on large amounts of data, which can be considered the time for the algorithm because a computer will take some time for each operation

One operation is understood as something that happens for each iteration of an algorithm, that takes constant time

Big O Notation
    -Used to describe the worst case time complexity for an algorithm
    -n represents the number of values in the data set
    O(1) - constant time
    O(n) - Linear time
    O(n^2) - Exponential time
    O(n * log(n)) - less time for small values more time for large values

Big O Notation in math is used to map the upper bound of a function
